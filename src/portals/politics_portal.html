    <main>
        <p>My views on politics have mostly been influenced by the Italian Elite School, that is, Vilfredo Pareto,
            Gaetano Mosca, and Robert Michels. This school was founded on the thought of Machiavelli, and given a
            notable boost by James Burnham.
        </p>

        <h2>The Prince</h2>

        <p><i>The Prince</i> by Machiavelli is a classic text, and is among the first true political science texts ever
            written. That is, Machiavelli was attempting to analyse politics in a scientific manner, the study of the
            use and distribution of power. The book was written as a gift to the de Medici family; Machiavelli hoped
            they could unite Italy under one banner to stop the smaller Italian states being bullied by larger ones.</p>

        <h2>The Machiavellians</h2>

        <p><i>The Machiavellians</i> by James Burnham is a modern revamp of Machiavellian thought and covers the
            thoughts of Italian Elite School theorists, as well as some contributions from Sorel. This is a seminal work
            in understanding modern politics, and there is no degree to which I would not stop recommending this work.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="http://newpolymath.home.blog/2021/02/21/beyond-left-and-right/">Beyond Left and Right</a></h2>

        <p>This is one of my proudest articles I have ever written. It is a long piece, and explores the concepts of
            "left wing" and "right wing". I simply think that these terms are borderline useless, and attempt to remedy
            the situation somewhat.</p>
