        <p>This is the urban planning portal. Around 2017 I picked up a keen interest in urban planning and design; why
            were our cities and towns organised in the way that they are? What impact does this have on our life? Is
            this moral? Answers to these questions came by largely exploring the post war consensus, so there is some
            overlap with the <a href="history_portal.html">history portal</a>, and urban planning also has a <a
                href="politics_portal.html">political element</a>. In general, I want less central planning of cities,
            which seems to have cause a whole range of problems.

                Better, Really</a></h2>

        <p>I wrote this article with the hope of giving an overview of my thoughts on improvements to the current design
            of cities. I focus on ways we can reduce the over-reliance on vehicles to manage transport, which seems to
            be the largest issue facing cities today.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://newpolymath.home.blog/2020/06/17/lessons-from-lockdown/">Lessons From Lockdown</a></h2>

        <p>I wrote this article at the height of the UK's lockdown. I figured I would use the situation to think about
            ways in which we could improve the overall quality of cities.</p>
