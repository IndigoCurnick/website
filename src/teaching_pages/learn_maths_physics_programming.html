    <main>
        <p>While I did an integrated masters physics course at the University of Sussex, it was, invariably, not that
            useful. I guess I learned a few tricks, but for the most part, not much of value was taught. Instead,
            invariably the best way to learn is to self teach. There are a huge number of resources out there these days
            for self learning, which I use. I hope I can give you a flavour of what's out there.</p>

        <p>Why am I teaching maths, physics and programming all at once? Well, if you want to learn one, you should
            probably learn the others, at least a little bit. Maybe if you just want to learn programming you can get
            away with not learning physics, but even then I consider maths to be essential. I work in research with some
            people who only studied programming and generally they struggle with mathematics, which isn't helpful for
            such a setting.</p>

        <h2>First Steps</h2>

        <p>First of all things, ditch your Mac. Whoever told you Apple products were good was lying to you. They're
            bloated and do not respect user privacy. After that, they're almost impossible to actually work with. Don't
            get smug if you're using Windows either. Switch to a good Linux distro - everything becomes easier after
            that. By "good Linux distro" I do not mean Ubuntu; actually I specifically rule out Ubuntu (which is
            bloated). A good beginner distro is Manjaro, but anything ArchLinux based will do just fine.</p>

        <p>Most scienfitic computing is done on Unix machines, and now that you have one, you'll probably need to learn
            how to use it. Switching from windows everywhere to simpler command line interfaces is a big change, but a
            very liberating one. https://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php</p>

        <p>You're first steps will focus on a few basics. First, you should familiarise yourself with \(LaTeX\)
        </p>

        <p>In terms of programming languages you should learn, just learn any Turing complete programming language. It
            doesn't matter that much. Once you learn one you can learn another pretty quickly actually. It's like
            learning a languages in real life but even easier again once you know one. The one thing you should look out
            for is whatever language you learn should be free (ideally open source but at least free). I can not
            emphasise this enough <em>do not use <code>Matlab</code></em>. No <code>Maple</code> either; just another
            flavour of junk. I know many scientists use them, but they costs thousands and thousands of pounds to use in
            a
            research or commercial setting. Imagine some snot-nosed rapacious lawyer sniffing around because you didn't
            pay your
            loicense fee on code on a paper you published. Ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Anyway, for my reccomendations for programming languages: <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>,
            <code>Python</code> (used sparringly), <code>R</code>, <code>Fortran</code>, <code>Rust</code>.
            <code>Python</code> is fine for some uses - I especially use it for making graphs, but I would not suggest
            it for a first language at all. Good first languages are <code>C++</code> or <code>Rust</code>. If you were
            temped by <code>Matlab</code>, go for <code>R</code>. I've already mentioned \(LaTeX\), which isn't really a
            programming language per se, but everyone should learn it.
        </p>

        <p>Depending on which Linux distro you went with, this could be a little different, but essentially to use any
            of these programming languages, you need to install them. The package manager for ArchLinux based distros is
            <code>pacman</code>, but the principles remain the same (<code>apt</code> is the package manager in many
            other distros)
        </p>

        <p>Ok, so you've armed yourself with a programming language, now what?</p>

        <h2>Just Beginning</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/">C++ Forum Programs</a></dt>
            <dd>A very famous C++ forum thread which has some programs that you can solve. While this is a C++ forum,
                you can go ahead and solve this in any language</dd>
            <dt>How to Prove It</dt>
            <dd>by Daniel J. Velleman, (ISBN 13) ‚Äé978-1108439534 </dd>
            <dd>This is one of the better introductiuon books I've found. It teaches helpful things like logic, which
                seem to get missed out of most mathematics textbooks. In fact, this is more of a logic book than it is a
                mathematics book.</dd>
            <dt>Principles of Physics</dt>
            <dd>by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker, (ISBN 13) 978-1118230749</dd>
            <dd>This was my physics textbook in year one. Frankly, it was the only book needed for the first two years
                of a degree. It's HUGE. You may find that you can move onto more advanced maths and programming texts
                until you are done with this one, I think that's ok. The next section will not have a physics textbook
                in it.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Honestly, these will take you some time to complete, and you'll be more than comfortable with all the basic
            concepts. Use Git and Github to keep track of your projects. When you do the maths and physics problems,
            turn them into \(LaTeX\) documents and add them to Github too. What's that? It's a lot and we've barely
            covered the basics? Yes. Did you expect this to be easy?
        </p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>

        <p>In this section you will continue working from Principles of Physics, which you might not have finished with
            (that's ok!). The goal in this section is to rapidly expand your knowledge of mathematics and get you
            independently solving programming problems.</p>
