Towards a Polymath Education
============================

Polymath simply is not the mode of education in the modern world. Most people are educated only very narrowly into one single field. Specialisation is the name of the game. We can see the reasons for this: jobs are specialised, and we need to be prepared for them. It's also challenging to be a polymath now, since there is just so much to learn. Is there any hope for a polymath conception of education?

I believe that there is. However, we shouldn't expect this to enter into the mainstream curriculum anytime soon. I think that instead we need to focus on ourselves and choose to become polymaths as adults. We must choose to become self-educated. But, what, exactly are we choosing?

We can always just read and learn in whatever suits us, of course. This has been the approach I and, I think, most people in the modern polymath movement have done. This involves just learning about whatever it happens to be that we find interesting. I don't think there is anything wrong with this, and as I've said before, it is still the case that reading an introductory book on a subject will invariably mean you will know more about it than probably 80% of the population. However, this approach is somewhat unstructured. Therefore, I've been thinking about a means by which we can structure a polymath education.

Last week I discussed a [definition of art](/blog/definition-of-art), in which I proposed that art is something that reaches a kind of knowledge, metaphorical knowledge to be exact. I also proposed that there are two other kinds of knowledge: rational and empirical. That forms the basis of my polymath education; becoming educated in the fields of rationalism, empiricism and metaphorical truth.

Practically, what might this look like? Well, to satisfy the requirement of rational truths we can study philosophy and logic. For empirical truths we can study physics, chemistry and other sciences. For metaphorical truths, we can read literature, study music and so on.

The ultimate underpin of all of this is, I think, writing. Writing is a skill that is apart from the other modes of truth and yet they all depend upon it to be realised. Writing clearly is the key to thinking clearly, as it crystallises our thought at any given moment in time, so we can review and revise it later.

Take these principles and apply them to your personal self-education journey. I am keen to see what you come up for yourself. As for me, I will continue to study philosophy and physics, as well as now adding literature, and a continued dedication to learn how to write.
