So, you want to speak Latin? The first thing to do is learn how to pronounce Latin! As a preface, there are generally two systems for pronouncing Latin: Classical Latin (mimicking the authentic pronunciation in the Roman Empire around the time of the start of the Christian period) and Ecclesiastical Latin (a more modern pronunciation used in the Catholic Church). I'll detail the pronunciation of each, and then opine about the current state of Latin pronunciation.

Some general introductory notes first. The Latin alphabet is the same as the modern English alphabet but it is lacking the letters *j* and *w*. Also, *y* is always a vowel in Latin, and never a consonant like in English sometimes (in English *y* can be both a vowel and a consonant e.g. in *gym* it is a vowel, in *yellow* it is a consonant). The letter 

## Latin Diacriticology 

In Latin, some accents or marks are used to help indicate whether a vowel is long or short. The marks are

- ◌̆ - the *breve*. This indicates the vowel is short. This is also optional, as vowels without a breve are short, too. It's mostly just used in some circumstances to clear up confusion
- ◌̄ - the *macron*. This indicates the vowel is long
- ◌̈ - the *diaeresis*. This indicates that the vowel it is on does not form a diphthong with the preceeding vowel e.g. *aër* is pronounced *a-er* as two distinct syllables. This mark is very rare

The accents should be considered a part of spelling as differences in pronunciation can change the meaning of a word. For example, *liber* means *book* but *līber* means free.

If you need help typing these characters I know of two good ways. On Linux systems, you can easily enable the *compose* key. I bound my compose key to my caps lock key, since I never use caps lock. On Manjaro, it can be enabled in the keyboard settings. The general way to use compose is like this: compose + accent + letter. So, examples using the letter *a* for Latin are

- compose + - + a = ā
- compose + b + a = ă
- compose + " + a = ä

\* There's really no English equivalent to *y* and *ȳ* in Latin - my suggestion would be to listen to a [spoken IPA chart](https://www.ipachart.com/?ref) of the symbols I provide (especially if you are not familiar with the French pronunciation of *tu*). Actually, it's wise to listen to all of them because these words I've used are approximations in my Southern British accent - Americans and Northerners could be wildly different.

^ when *i* comes at the start of a word, it takes on a sound somewhat like an English consonant *y* - kind of like the *y* in *yew*. The IPA is *j*

\* this sound does not exist in English but think a Spanish *perro* or a Welsh *amser*. This is called an alveolar trill. Not like a French "rolled" r which is a uvular fricative. For English speakers this will probably be the most challenging sound in classical Latin to make. Growing up in Wales, this is a very easy sound for me - but some people had to go to special talk classes to get this down for the Welsh language!

^ in some English accents the *x* is softened to a kind of *gz* sound. Some people say *exert* something like *egzert*. In Latin it's always a hard *ks* sound.

Also, *bs* and *bt* are usually pronounced like *ps* and *pt*. For example, the word *urbs* is usually pronounced like *ur-ps*

## How to Pronounce Ecclesiastical Latin

I tend to think of classical Latin as a "hard" sound, but ecclesiastical Latin is a much more "soft" sound. The pronunciation is more or less the same as in Italian

**Vowels**

Unlike classical Latin, ecclesiastical Latin does not differentiate between long and short vowels.

\* the rolling here is softer than in classical Latin, kind of like the Spanish *peron*. Just a quick tap rather than an extended roll

## "Modern" Latin Pronunciation 

Ultimately, Latin is a "dead" language and as such there is no official pronunciation guide. From what I've observed, most people who learn Latin now stick fairly close to the classical pronunciation with the following differences

- *v* pronounced like a modern English *v* rather than with a *w* sound
- *bs* and *bt* are pronounced with a *b* sound rather than the *p* sound. *Urbs* is this pronounced how it is read rather than like *urps*
