These are the solutions to the exercises given in [this article](/blog/2025-03-22/introduction-sentential-logic-1),
but make sure you try them all yourself first!

1)

Yes. If only one of two people can win, and one can't even make it, then there's only one possible winner

2)

No. There's no reason to believe that John will win the fishing contest again just because he won it before.

3)

Yes. This is a very classic argument form, which can be summarised as

- P1: All \\(A\\) are \\(B\\)
- P2: \\(C\\) is an \\(A\\)
- C: \\(C\\) is a \\(B\\)

4)

Yes. Another classic argument form, which can be summarised as

- P1: All \\(A\\) are \\(B\\)
- P2: No \\(C\\) are \\(B\\)
- C: No \\(A\\) is a \\(C\\)

5)

Yes. This is a very important classic argument form called a _modus ponens_

- P1: If \\(P\\) then \\(Q\\)
- P2: \\(P\\)
- C: Therefore, \\(Q\\)

6)

No, this is a logical fallacy which looks very similar to _modus ponens_ but is actually invalid, called _affirming the consequent_. Premises 1 does not say the _only_ way for the ground to be wet is if it is raining. Someone could have used a hose or a pip could have burst. 

The formal form of _affirming the consequent_ is 

- P1: If \\(P\\), then \\(Q\\)
- P2: \\(Q\\)
- C: Therefore, \\(P\\)

If you ever see an argument of this form, it is invalid!

7)

Yes. This is a classical argument form called _modus tollens_ which can be summarised as

- P1: If \\(P\\), then \\(Q\\)
- P2: Not \\(Q\\)
- C: Therefore, not \\(P\\)

8)

No, this is another logical fallacy similar to the _modus tollens_ called _denying the antecedent_. Just as in 6) the premise does not say the _only_ way for the ground to be wet is rain.

The formal form of _denying the antecedent_ is

- P1: If \\(P\\), then \\(Q\\)
- P2: Not \\(P\\)
- C: Therefore, not \\(Q\\)
