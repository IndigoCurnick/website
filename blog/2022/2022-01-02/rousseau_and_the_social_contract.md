<h1>Rousseau and the Social Contract</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This work will primarily serve to be a reflection on <em>The Social Contract</em> by Jean-Jacque Rousseau. In this
    work Rousseau deals with questions of human nature, freedom, and what is meant by the "general will" and "social
    contract" and the means by which a government should be organised.</p>

<p>The Social Contract contains the most famous work by social and political theorist Rousseau. This work contains his
    concepts of the organisation of government, and the way in which one can justify this government. Rousseau makes the
    argument that the Social Contract can exist and the fact that society exists means that to some extent people
    consent to it. I hope I can live up to Voltaire’s expectations above and, rather than odiously burn the text, I can
    have the wit to reply to it.</p>

<h2 id="rousseau-on-early-humans-and-human-nature">Rousseau on Early Humans and Human Nature</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let us first consider Rousseau’s view of human nature. Rousseau thinks that very early humans lived solitary lives,
    hardly seeing other humans, and with few needs and abundant resources there was little need for competition. At this
    time, there would be no private property, and so no inequality. Moreover, humans were naturally empathetic and so
    had no desire to ever harm one another. It was only the "invention", so to speak, of private property that made
    humans corrupted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I trust I do not need to explain why this view of humanity is totally detached from reality. In fact, it is Rousseau
    himself who provides the evidence this view of humans can not be correct. Rousseau mentions Robinson Crusoe as being
    the master of his island - "anyway, Adam was undeniably sovereign of the world, as Robinson Crusoe was of his
    island, as long as he was its only inhabitant; and this empire had the advantage that the monarch, safe on his
    throne, had nothing to fear from rebellions, wars, or conspirators". Alone on his island, Crusoe is capable of
    cultivating private property. It is not "invented" at some discreet time, but rather the natural process of Crusoe
    engaging in cultivating produce to sustain himself. As Mises observes "unemployment in the unhampered market is
    always voluntary"; but what does this mean, exactly? In a totally unhampered market (of which Crusoe is currently a
    sole member (therefore no trade is currently possible)), Crusoe always has the opportunity to generate wealth via
    the means of homesteading, that is, by mixing his labour with scarce and otherwise unclaimed resources. Crusoe is
    always employed so long as he continues to exist, for he must always engage in homesteading to sustain himself. As a
    practical example, Crusoe may pick bananas off of trees or make a spear to hunt wild boar. These are all examples of
    the ways in which he might mix his labour with scarce resources for profit (the profit here being, of course, life
    and comfort rather than a monetary profit, as no money exists in Crusoe’s market (for he is the only member, and
    trade being impossible, has no need for it)).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does the result of this calculation vary once a second person enters the island? Not in the slightest. Now that
    Friday has arrived on the island, both men must engage in homesteading for sustenance . The only change of
    significance is now some form of trade is possible. That being that Crusoe may engage more in the hunting of boar
    and Friday may engage more in the picking of bananas, and then they exchange these items. The benefit here is there
    is some efficiency from the economy of scale, so, after the trade is done, each may end up with more than if he had
    hunted boar and picked bananas separately. If this seems odd, just consider a few reasons, perhaps the boar hunting
    grounds are best on the other side of the island, so changing jobs from picking to hunting requires some
    transportation time. Whereas, staying with one job for a whole day eliminates this needless movement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Already, we have found significant issues with the foundations of Rousseau’s theory, nevertheless, we must persist.
    At any rate, Rousseau’s view that the invention of property was a kind of "fall from grace" moment simply isn’t
    true; property is a necessity and inevitable by product of homesteading as a means of survival. Moreover, the view
    that no greed, competition, inequality or violence existed between humans before a certain date is obviously
    incorrect. I don’t think I even need to state in too much detail why. However, I will note that Rousseau appears to
    me to be trying to create an alternative Garden of Eden, one that does not require a God. Of course, any such
    attempts are obviously doomed to failure since the Garden of Eden is understood as a metaphysical place and not a
    real place. Although it wasn’t my intention when starting this article, as I write this, I do wonder whether
    Rousseau views his social contract in a quasi-religious manner. It is often said that atheists will make a religion
    of their science, and I think here is certainly an ideal example.</p>

<h2 id="on-definitions-of-freedom">On Definitions of Freedom</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rousseau’s position on freedom is of direct relevance to us. He considers freedom to be a triumph of reason over
    passions. Now, this isn’t in of itself a terrible partial definition of freedom. Certainly, we can observe some to
    become slaves to their own passions; to be masters of ourselves we must reject an animalistic way of life and
    embrace what we are of the highest order; that is – human. However, two problems present themselves immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first is of Rousseau’s position of early man: he claims men were "born free but everywhere in chains", that is,
    that early man was "free". Is it likely that very early humans showed a triumph of reason over passion? Indeed, it
    was likely that most resources were scarce and immediate survival was a higher priority than philosophy. Given how
    seemingly little philosophy has advanced over the last few thousand years it certainly seems challenging indeed, it
    seems unlikely that many were engaged in it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second problem is the definition in of itself. A man could be a master over his own passions and totally
    enlightened, yet kept in a cage – can we really call him <em>free</em>. Indeed, Ayn Rand in <em>Capitalism: The
        Unknown Ideal</em> defines freedom very simply as "freedom, in a political context, has only one meaning:
    <em>the absence of physical coercion</em>". What does this mean? Put simply it means that without physical violence
    being used against us we can become free. Rand was not without an understanding of reason in her definition of
    freedom; in <em>For the New Intellectual</em> she writes "These two—reason and freedom—are corollaries, and their
    relationship is reciprocal: when men are rational, freedom wins; when men are free, reason wins". There is, then,
    some component of reason in her definition of freedom, but this stems naturally from the lack of physical coercion.
    Indeed in <em>Philosophy: Who Needs It</em> she gives a much more expanded definition:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><em>Do not be misled ... by an old collectivist trick which goes like this: there is no absolute freedom anyway,
            since you are not free to murder; society limits your freedom when it does not permit you to kill;
            therefore, society holds the right to limit your freedom in any manner it sees fit; therefore, drop the
            delusion of freedom—freedom is whatever society decides it is.</em></p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><em>It is not society, nor any social right, that forbids you to kill—but the inalienable individual right of
            another man to live. This is not a “compromise” between two rights—but a line of division that preserves
            both rights untouched. The division is not derived from an edict of society—but from your own inalienable
            individual right. The definition of this limit is not set arbitrarily by society—but is implicit in the
            definition of your own right.</em></p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><em>Within the sphere of your own rights, your freedom is absolute.</em></p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What we see here then is a stark rejection of "society" imposing physical coercion on a man. He is free so long as
    this condition is true; and all men are free so long as <em>he</em> does not use physical coercion against them. Or
    again in <em>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</em>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

    <p><em>Freedom, in a political context, means freedom from government coercion. It does not mean freedom from the

            automatic prosperity. It means freedom from the coercive power of the state—and nothing else.</em></p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What does this mean for Rousseau? Rousseau considers a similar question in <em>The Social Contract</em>, he writes
    "you will ask: ‘how can a man be both free and forced to conform to wills that are not his own’". Indeed, this
    appears to be a sticking point here – how is this possible? Rousseau answers: "I reply that the question is wrongly
    put. The citizen gives his consent to <em>all</em> the laws, including ones that are passed against his opposition,
    and even laws that punish him when he dares break any laws. The constant will of all the members of the state is the
    general will; by virtue of it they are citizens and free". Unfortunately, we will have to totally disagree with
    Rousseau here. We simply only need ask what happens when a man does not wish to, or can not morally, consent to a
    law (you may think of any number of real life laws governments have passed that are totally evil), and I leave it up
    to the reader what "general will" of the populace would have to do to such an individual in order to maintain the
    social order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h2 id="the-general-will">The General Will</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rousseau’s view on the general will extends beyond what we could call <em>absolute</em>. Rousseau says "to protect
    the social compact from being a mere empty formula, therefore, it silently includes the undertaking that anyone who
    refuses to obey the general will is to be compelled to do so by the whole body. This single item in the compact can
    give power to all the other items. It means nothing less than that each individual <strong>will be forced to be
        free</strong>". What we see here is nothing short of a logical contradiction. Even taking Rousseau’s own
    definition of freedom, that is, a triumph of reason over instincts, we must ask – by what means would we do this?
    Any methodology in which we engage in this would lead us only into some kind of social engineering or "reeducation".
    What this means, in reality, is putting a gun to people’s heads till they agree with you (verbally, at least,
    people, under such circumstances, do not have a tendency to <em>actually</em> change their own views – making them
    <em>not free</em> under Rousseau’s own definition). Notwithstanding, any such "forced education" can only be
    described as physical coercion, thus denying the more robust definition of freedom given by Rand (and others).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><em>It follows from all this that the general will is always in the right and always works for the public good;
            but it doesn’t follow that the people’s deliberations are always equally correct. Our will is always for our
            own good, but we don’t always see what that is; the populace is never corrupted, but it is often deceived,
            and then—but only then—it seems to will something bad.</em></p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><em>The will of all is very different from the general will; the latter looks only to the common interest, while
            the former looks to private interest and is no more than a sum of particular wills: but remove from these
            same wills the pluses and minuses that cancel one another and what is left of the particular wills adds up
            to the general will.</em></p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><em>If the populace held its deliberations (on the basis of adequate information) without the citizens
            communicating with one another, what emerged from all the little particular wills would always be the
            general will, and the decision would always be good. But when plots and deals lead to the formation of
            partial associations at the expense of the big association, the will of each of these associations—the
            general will of its members—is still a particular will so far as the state is concerned; so that it can then
            be said that as many votes as there are men is replaced by as many votes as there are associations. The
            particular wills become less numerous and give a less general result. And when one of these associations is
            so great as to prevail over all the rest, the result is no longer a sum of small particular wills but a
            single particular will; and then there is no longer a general will, and the opinion that prevails is purely
            particular</em></p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here we must take great issue with Rousseau. He does not seem capable of considering the very question that he asks,
    namely: "can the general will ever be wrong?". He certainly answers "can a particular will masquerade as the general
    will", but this "general will" is what we are concerned with here. Can <em>it</em> ever be wrong? Indeed, what would
    it mean for the "general will" to be right. Just as we have seen with democracy, politicans elected do not always do
    the right thing. That seems clear. And I don’t just mean morally, I also mean pragmatically. Poor economic policy
    has robbed some nations of prosperity, all voted for. In the other sense, morally, we can we really imagine that a
    group of people will never make an immoral decision just because there is a crowd; after all, we oppose mob justice
    for just this reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His view on collectives is also unrealistic. Rousseau claims that</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><em>As long as a number of men gathered together regard them- selves as a single body, they have only a single
            will, which is concerned with the survival and well-being of all of them. In this case, the state’s
            machinery is all vigorous and simple and its rules clear and luminous; there’s no tangle of hidden agendas;
            the common good is always obvious, and only good sense is needed to perceive it.</em></p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is this really true? I think only a short amount of thought will reveal it is not. Indeed, at least some of the
    people involved in such a collective would become "corrupted" (by Rousseau’s definition, at least); thinking of
    themselves and trying to improve their own situation through use of the force of the state. This is only natural and
    failing to take it into account is a huge oversight for Rousseau. Consider what Burnham says on reflection of
    Michels in <em>The Machiavellians</em>. Burnham tells us that a true democracy, that is "self rule", is possible in
    a very small group of adults who all share the same goal in that particular situation. When Burnham says "small" he
    is thinking of single digit numbers. As soon as this group grows practical details that Rousseau does not consider
    come to light: is there anyone that it would be wise to exclude from the decision making process? Children?
    Criminals? Who decides the boundaries of this exclusion? When a group grows in this size, the likelihood that a
    decision that everyone can agree to is reached drops to almost null (and if one <em>is</em> reached, the next
    decision, or the next or the next or the… will eventually cause an unresolvable difference); at least some people
    are going to have to be coerced in some way to accepting decisions they do not agree with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A more subtle but important point Rousseau misses here Burnham also explains. Rousseau presents such a system as
    though there will be no leaders in such a general meeting. Burnham is dismissive of this. There may be no formal
    leaders; that is, there may not be a president, prime minister, chief and so on; however, a real leader is almost
    inevitable: there shall be some who have more experience, wealth or respect due to their age, knowledge, wisdom or
    action which give them more power in any such system than others. Consider the following thought experiment. Four
    people are kidnapped in their sleep and dropped via parachute into the four corners of a field. Within one minute
    they have all met one another. Within 15 minutes the group either has a leader, or it has dissolved. Such is the
    nature of humans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h2 id="the-social-contract">The Social Contract</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what is the social contract? The social contract is broadly defined as a theory that an individual, explicitly or
    tacitly, surrenders some of their freedoms to the state in exchange for protection of the remaining freedoms from
    the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having already covered Rousseau’s position on the "general will", we see how logically, a social contract can follow
    from it. Given my critiques of the assumptions of Rousseau by now, I think it should not be a surprise to any reader
    I continue to have a laundry list of issues with his idea of a social contract also.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rousseau is, however, very coy about actually defining such a contract. The social contract "never have been
    explicitly stated, they are everywhere the same and everywhere tacitly accepted and recognised". I trust you see
    that IF such "social contracts" exist, they are not everywhere the same, they are obviously not universally
    recognised (else I would not be writing this article). I trust the reader also understands how a contract that is
    never stated, such that both parties do not clearly understand what is contained within it <em>is no contract at
        all</em>. This is especially true when this contract is handing powers over to some kind of state – it now has a
    blank contract with which it can impose any will it wishes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rousseau provides a handy summary of what an individual would lose and gain by the social contract he lays out. A man
    would stand to lose:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>"his natural liberty"</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>"an unrestricted right to anything he wants and can get"</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a man stands to gain:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>"civil liberty"</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>"the ownership of everything he possesses"</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rousseau differentiates between natural liberty ("which is limited only by the individual’s powers") from civil
    liberty ("which is limited by the general will"). And he differentiates possession ("which is merely the effect of
    force or the principle of ‘first come; first served’") from property ("which can only be based on a positive
    title").</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Immediately problems with this arise. Firstly, his definition of "natural liberty" is suspect; harking back to Rand
    or Crusoe alone on his island, we know that no such "natural liberty" exists beyond the space at which he can mix
    his own labour with resources. As Rand saliently points out one is not<em> free</em> to murder just because he is
    capable of such an act.His definition of "civil liberty" also falls flat – to say we become "free" in some other way
    by placing the arbitrary restrictions of the "general will" upon us is simply a misnomer. Finally, to differentiate
    between these two "liberties" is simply tyrannical. We are free, at our liberty, when there is no physical coercion
    against us. The imposition of this "general will" is the opposite of liberty – it is pure anti-liberty. Indeed, his
    definition of "possession" and "property" is not appropriate. He says that possession is "merely" first come, first
    serve; it is not "merely" at all – the mixing of one’s labour with original, unappropriated goods is the absolute
    cornerstone of property. To say that pieces of paper issued by the government somehow makes this more legitimate is
    akin to the state as a religion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rousseau goes further than this to state that "man naturally has a right to everything he needs". Such, of course, is
    false. Crusoe, alone on his island, obviously has no such right. He may freely mix his labour with original
    unappropriated resources to produce some of the things he needs, but this is totally different to a "right" to these
    final goods. In order to have a right to the final goods of this chain <em>somebody else would have to mix their
        labour with resources</em>. Such is called slavery, if done under the threat of physical coercion. Perhaps
    though, what Rousseau means by this is naturally man has a right to mix his labour with original unappropriated
    resources, but (and I think by now a pattern is emerging), Rousseau’s language is too vague and too imprecise to get
    any gauge on what he really means. Charitably, the statement is useless. Consider closer what it means for something
    to be a "right". To declare something a "right" means we unequivocally believe this right is an irrevocable aspect
    of humans qua humans. Certainly for physical goods (say, bananas) we simply do not have an infinite supply (and, of
    course, the infinite supply of labour to harvest them) to make bananas an irrevocable aspect of humanity qua
    humanity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rousseau does have some redeeming qualities however. One of the consequences of his view of democracy is that states
    must be small – small enough that everyone in them can meet frequently. It is in these meetings that democracy takes
    place, not so much at the mass ballot box of today. Western civilisations like Britain or America would not count as
    democracies to Rousseau.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think my critiques of Rousseau have been through enough now, I will leave him on this quote. I trust by now you see
    that this is only a summary of madness:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><em>A state governed like that doesn’t need many laws; and when new ones are needed, everyone will see that they
            are. The first man to propose them is merely putting into words what they have all been thinking, and
            there’s no place here for deals or for eloquence in order to get passed into law something that each of them
            has already decided to do as soon as he’s sure that the rest will act with him.</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The primary issues that come with the "social contract" come in both of the terms. One, we must ask what is a
    "society"? Insofar, I have never become aware of any proof for a society; and those who claim its existence say it
    is simply evident. Well, I do not find this to be the case. Instead, what I find is the term is defined so loosely
    and used so loosely that anything, everything and nothing could be "society", and without a rigorous definition (a
    definition whereby I can guarantee my use of "society", after being defined, enters your mind and means the same
    thing) simply has not been achieved. Secondly, "contract" also poses an issue. In what way is this a contract?
    Indeed, I did not ever sign this contract, and when I ask proponents of this theory to produce the contract in
    detail, they seem unable to. Indeed, even when giving vague alludes to what is in this so-called contract there
    appears to be huge disagreement. The truth is, of course, no such "contract" exists or has ever been formulated in
    any kind of detail, such that "social contract" can mean anything, everything and nothing, in order to justify
    whatever it is that the invoker would like to mean.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This brings us to another issue, that is, consent. Imagine a robber accosts you on the street:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Give me all your money!" says the robber.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If panic and fear didn't totally overcome you, you might say something like "You have no right to my money!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Oh, I do, you are bound by the <em>Looter Contract</em>" replies the robber</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I have never agreed to any such contract!" you would reply, in earnest!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Yes you did, the contract is <em>implied</em>"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you think my example is far fetched, consider now this one:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Give me all your money and your house" says the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"But this is my money and house, you have no right to take it!" you protest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Your <em>social contract</em> compels you to obey the <em>general will</em>, which has determined this is right."
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I never agreed to any such contract!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Yes, you did, this contract is <em>implied</em>"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This brief imaginary exchange highlights the underlying issue with the social contract. What makes sex not rape?
    Consent. What makes a purchase in a shop not theft? Consent (NOT the payment – it is still theft to take an item
    without permission and leave the money). What makes the "social contract" not an authoritarian presumption on a free
    individual? Magic fairy dust, it seems. Indeed, I have argued with some proponents of the theory and apparently it
    is <em>implied</em> that I have agreed to this contract. By what means?</p>
