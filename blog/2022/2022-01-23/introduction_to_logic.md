<h1>A Very Short Introduction to Logic</h1>

<p>Some people in the modern world will boldly declare that we do not need logic. Logic is, after all, to them, nothing
    more than a convenient side effect of biology that helps us survive in a jungle or a conspiratorial system created
    to make sure mathematics and sciences remain inaccessible to certain groups of people. Neither of these framings of
    logic are true. In fact, logic can be framed in a third way - the way I will consider logic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I consider logic to be almost below natural phenomena - describing exactly what are the boundaries of what is
    possible. I consider logic to be so fundamental that if other universes exist that are totally different to our own
    the exact same laws of logic will apply. After all, in what universe can some object be at once containing all
    properties of A and no properties of A?</p>

<p>Recently I have been studying logic via using the seminal text "How to Prove It" by Velleman. I have the most recent
    edition, from 2019. in the book Velleman teachs us how to think in a systematically logical way. The motivation for
    Velleman is to be able to prove mathematical statements, but I think for a more general reader the motivation would
    be to learn logic itself.</p>

<p>I'll give you a flavour of the system of logic, and I trust you will see the potential uses of it. Consider the
    following three arguments</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>It will either rain or snow tomorrow</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>It is too warm for snow</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>Therefore, it will rain</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>Either the butler is guilty or the maid is guilty</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>Either the main is guilty or the cook is guilty</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>Therefor, either the butler is guilty or the cook is guilty</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>All scramjammers are examples of flangerumblers</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>The losipolisy is a scramjammer</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li>Therefore, the losipolisy is a flangerumbler</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What can we say about these arguments? Each of them has three lines, that is, two<em> propositions</em> and one<em>
        conclusion</em>. There are many more complex forms, but today let's just focus on this simple<em>
        syllogism</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arguments number one and three are most similar in the sense that they are <em>valid</em>. What does valid mean?
    Valid means that both propositions, if true, lead to the conclusion. We can see that if it <em>must</em> either snow
    or rain tomorrow, but it is too hot for snow, it <em>must </em>rain. Argument three is a more definitional argument.
    Notice how we have no idea what a scramjammer or a flangerumbler is; but we can still conclude that the argument is
    at least valid. Notice how these statements are always "true" or "correct" in the sense that <em>if</em> both
    propositions are true the conclusion must necessarily be true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How would we attack such an argument then? We could do so by realising that both propositions may not actually be
    true. For example, must it really rain or snow tomorrow? Could neither happen? Is this losipolisy really a
    scramjammer? Could it not be something else?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is in contrast to argument two â€“ which is not valid. The propositions, even if both true, do not lead to the
    conclusion. When attacking this argument, you could try and argue that the propositions are not true, but in general
    when confronted with such an argument should point out that it is not valid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope to turn this into a series of articles that will explain some of the techniques of logic and proofs. Keep an
    eye out for them!</p>
