        <p>This is the history portal. All of my historical work is listed here, as well as influential history books to
            me. I mostly focus on the theories of history itself rather than specific events. When I do focus on
            specific historical events, I focus on the Anglo-Dutch relationship in history. Its critical importance
            is severely understudied. It culminated in the creation of South Africa and handing Jan
            Smuts significant global political power, laying the ideological foundations for the global modern world.
