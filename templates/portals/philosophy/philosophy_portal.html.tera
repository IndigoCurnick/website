    <main>
        <p>Philosophically I have mostly been interested in epistemology, that is, questions regarding what can we know?
            I am also interested, though, in a broad range of philosophical concepts.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://newpolymath.home.blog/2021/08/28/what-can-we-know/">What Can We Know?</a></h2>

        <p>This article, inspired by Hans-Hermann Hoppe, details much of my thoughts on epistemology. In some ways it
            can be seen as a sort of epistemological manifesto</p>

        <h2>The Pre-Socratics</h2>

        <p>I have taken a large interest in the pre-Socratic philosophers. At the moment I have two articles of many
            written regarding a summary of these thinkers, or at least, what little we know of them. <a

                one</a> deals with the Milesian School and <a
