        <p>The pre-Socratics are a collection of philosophers that came quite literally before Socrates. This is a period of
            history from around 635BC to around 440BC, although quite a number of the later pre-Socratics were actually
            contemporaries of Socrates himself. After Socrates' death, and with the rising of Plato and Aristotle, philosophy
            took a fundamentally different course. These early philosophers are of great interest to me because they represent
            some of the earliest serious thinkers that we have records of.</p>

        <h2>On Sources</h2>
        <!-- /wp:heading -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Given the age of the thinkers, it should come as no surprise that the majority of their works are lost. The question
            immediately arises how we know anything about them. The primary sources that are still present are some fragments
            that have been preserved by Simplicus and others. As secondary sources, many other writers like Plato, Aristotle,
            and Diogenes Laertius provided critique and commentary.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>I have not directly referenced the pre-Socratics when discussing their work. It would feel wrong to when the work
            does not exist, is incomplete, the title is not known and so on. Instead, I have referenced <em>Philosophy Before
                Socrates</em> by Richard D McKirahan and <em>The Presocratic Philosophers</em> by Jonathan Barnes which contain
            most of the preserved fragments between them. McKirahan is easier to understand for the general reader, so I suggest
            starting with him if you do wish to learn more about these thinkers. Barnes presents an extremely dense and detailed
            account, and is probably the most thorough and comprehensive account of the pre-Socratics we have. As for other
            modern academic sources, I have also used <em>History of Western Philosophy </em>by Bertrand Russel and <em>History
                of Philosophy</em> by A. C. Grayling. Grayling really seems to be rewriting Russel here, but he does offer
            different interpretations and commentary on the thinkers.</p>

        <p>Here I must also thank the Perseus Digital Library, who have wonderfully digitised and indexed ancient Greek and
            Roman texts. The ability to search not only titles but also the text for words was of indispensable importance. In
            this way, I was able to find many places across the ages where some small reference was made to the thinkers in
            question.</p>

        <h2>On Order</h2>
        <!-- /wp:heading -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>The order in which to present the thinkers is troublesome. The issue broadly is that the thinkers are grouped into
            schools of thought, but these schools may extend for 200 years. This means that some members of the school might be
            influenced by a thinker from a different school. For example, Philolaus was a member of the Pythagorean school who
            was influenced by Democritus. This presents me with a dilemma. Do I present the material in groups of the schools,
            or do I go chronologically. While going chronologically would eliminate any confusion that arises from
            cross-pollination of the schools, I elected in the end to introduce the pre-Socratics grouped into their respective
            schools. I think this gives a much better flavour of what they are about, especially since there is often not much
            variation of thought within a given school.</p>

        <h2>On Socrates</h2>
        <!-- /wp:heading -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>While this is a series on the pre-Socratics, I have elected to include Socrates. I originally wrote the article on
            Socrates not in relation to this series, but will add it to the end as I think a summary of Socrates is a good way
            to round off the study of the pre-Socratics. After reading about the earlier philosophers you will immediately
            understand why Socrates is the break point; it is not some mistake, convention, arbitrary choice or accident of
            history â€“ there is a real, genuine difference before and after his influence.</p>
