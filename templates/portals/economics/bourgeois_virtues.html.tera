        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>I recently read <em>The Bourgeois Virtues </em>by Deirdre McCloskey. This is the first work of her Bourgeois series,
            that I hope to read and write about over the coming year. The scope of her work is vast and I certainly can not do
            the work full justice here. I will say that it was an excellent read and I strongly suggest it. Thankfully, despite
            being such a huge book, copies are quite cheap online.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>McCloskey begins with a lengthy introduction in which she describes the reactions to her wanting to write a book
            about bourgeois virtues. People would laugh. After all – a bourgeois is nothing but a capitalist, and capitalism is
            nothing but greed, so they say.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Not McCloskey. She argues several things across the book. I will outline the basic arguments now and then delve into
            them in some greater detail in a moment. She argues that capitalism is good for us: makes us richer and allows us to
            live longer. Capitalism also gives us the space and encouragement to develop the classical virtues as described by
            St Thomas Aquinas. Therefore, anti-capitalism is bad for us: physically and "spiritually". The book is huge – 616
            pages in all. As such, the scope of topics covered in it is very large indeed. I can not hope to cover all of it in
            this one article, so I will focus on introducing the bourgeois virtues themselves and why they are needed.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>I was keen to read that McCloskey was approaching the problem as a polymath:</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:quote -->
        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
            <!-- wp:paragraph -->
            <p>To tell the Adam-Smithian story of bourgeois virtues required schooling in ethics, theology, classics, poetry,
                sociology, social psychology, literary history, art history, intellectual history, philosophy and twenty other
                fields</p>
            <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        </blockquote>
        <!-- /wp:quote -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Indeed, a polymath approach will be necessary for such a large and complex task – and I applaud her for it.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>The central argument spread out across this massive work is that the seven virtues are necessary for a good bourgeois
            society. These virtues stem from Christianity, although McCloskey does a more global analysis to show the same
            concepts can be found in world religions. At any rate, the names and definitions will be used from Christianity,
            specifically St Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas defines the following virtues:</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:list -->
        <ul>
            <!-- wp:list-item -->
            <li>love,</li>
            <!-- /wp:list-item -->
        
            <!-- wp:list-item -->
            <li>faith,</li>
            <!-- /wp:list-item -->
        
            <!-- wp:list-item -->
            <li>hope,</li>
            <!-- /wp:list-item -->
        
            <!-- wp:list-item -->
            <li>courage,</li>
            <!-- /wp:list-item -->
        
            <!-- wp:list-item -->
            <li>temperance,</li>
            <!-- /wp:list-item -->
        
            <!-- wp:list-item -->
            <li>prudence,</li>
            <!-- /wp:list-item -->
        
            <!-- wp:list-item -->
            <li>justice.</li>
            <!-- /wp:list-item -->
        </ul>
        <!-- /wp:list -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>First McCloskey looks at love. Here she is not talking about romantic love, <em>eros</em>, but rather a more
            charitable <em>agape</em>. Concern with those around us. How would this manifest? In a bourgeois society we could
            imagine neighbours who are all concerned with each others' wellbeing; or shopkeepers all at the same market looking
            out for one another. A friendly relationship between business owner and customer; a friendly relationship between
            employer and employee. This isn't some sort of socialist-anarchist fantasy but something that is very real. Some
            places have it more than others, unfortunately. Some neighbourhoods are "nice" compared with others. What do the
            not-so-nice neighbourhoods lack? They are ostensibly not bourgeois and lack this virtue.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Businesses that practice a bourgeois virtue of love towards their workers respect them for their labour.
            Unfortunately what we might call <em>managerial capitalism</em> has tried to do away with this approach. It tries to
            turn employees into cookie-cutter replacements of one another. When I was managing in nightclubs I always tried my
            best to not do that. In a way, it's <em>insane</em> to not respect the skills and labour of your employees – they
            are responsible for the basic service that your customers come for!</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>McCloskey next turns her attentions to faith. Faith is about integrity and identity. A bourgeois society doesn't just
            persist forever and ever, like a clockwork machine. It can degenerate. It's as much about the culture, behaviour and
            virtue of the citizens as it is about any governmental economic policy. Let's say we have a bourgeois society – how
            do we keep it alive?</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>By faith. By having faith in ourselves as a bourgeois, and passing on these values to the next generation. We hope to
            maintain a culture that has faith in itself – a culture that has faith that if it continues to act as it does,
            continues to hold dear what it does, it can persist for the betterment of everyone involved.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Hope is like faith, but while faith is about preservation, hope is about growth. Hope is what allows us to continue
            to develop. The entrepreneur hopes his invention will sell and make him rich. I hope that by exercising and eating
            healthy I will live longer. We hope for a better future. Without hope we give way to sloth. When sloth enters a
            culture it can only diminish from there. Resources are consumed, never to be replenished. The standards of living
            slip for everyone.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Staying industrious is not merely some mechanical thing that humans can do over and over and over without any second
            thought. It is difficult to wake up at five every morning and go out into the frost to tend the fields. Certainly we
            wouldn't do that if we had no hope for betterment to come from it.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Next McCloskey tackles courage. Courage is often seen as a very masculine virtue – something that we find no shortage
            of in the ancient Greek texts and many other foundational myths. Men going out to conquer great evils, or to defend
            a homeland. At any rate, there could (and probably) will come times when the bourgeois society needs to be defended.
            Great men with great courage will be needed if it is to survive.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Nevertheless, this isn't the only kind of courage that McCloskey is thinking of. Just like our entrepreneur needs
            faith he also needs courage. To put himself out there, to metaphorically go where no man has gone before requires
            great courage. Inevitably all new inventions, businesses and so on will be met by critical people asking why we need
            whatever the entrepreneur has brought before us. Sometimes, they are right, sometimes, they are wrong. Whether right
            or wrong, without courage, that new business or invention will never get anywhere.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>The next virtue is prudence. Prudence is about practical knowledge – about a way of going about day-to-day business
            in a savvy way. A very simple example might be not selling goods at a loss. Prudence helps temper courage. With an
            excess of courage and no prudence we might invest heavily in whatever comes our way with no sense of risk – of
            course, why wouldn't we! We are so bold and great, success is sure to come. Sometimes it might. Most of the time we
            would probably lose a lot of money. Prudence helps us mitigate these sorts of risks.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>I think it is easy to see how prudence is essential for a bourgeois society. Without it, everyone is going to quickly
            jettison their wealth on malinvestments that will never justify their expense. We need to be prudent to persist,
            economically speaking.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Justice is the last of the virtues. Justice might be one of the most important bourgeois virtues. A bourgeois society
            is based on trust it is often said, but trust in <em>what</em>. Trust in justice. In order for a bourgeois society
            to persist, each must be able to trust that all others are following a similar understanding of justice.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Justice is very broad. Of course, it does apply with regards to crime. We require systems of justice to punish
            criminals and to compensate those that have had such crimes committed against them. But that's not what we are
            primarily thinking of. Instead, we are thinking about lenders who can trust that money will be paid back, we think
            of customers who can trust they will get what they pay for. High trust between everyone, even strangers, is
            essential for a bourgeois society to take hold.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
        
        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Now, for today I only want to cover the virtues themselves and why they are needed for a bourgeois society. I hope to
            cover soon some more topics from the book such as, why would we want to be a bourgeois society at all and what
            causes the bourgeois virtues to disappear. Until then, think about how these bourgeois virtues would be able to
            benefit you if they were widespread.</p>
