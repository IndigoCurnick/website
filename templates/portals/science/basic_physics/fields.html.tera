        </p>

        <p>Up until now we have discussed how objects move due to forces, 
            but we have not discussed how forces are generated nor discussed 
            energy at all. 
        </p>

        <p>Everyone knows that positive charges attract negative charges and 
            repel positive ones. However, let's look more into understanding
            how much force this attraction and repulsion generates. What we
            won't be covering here is the specifics of what a field actually is.
            For our purposes a field is anything which affects a space and 
            generates forces on other objects in that space. 
        </p>

        <p>The formula of the magnitude of a force in an electrostatic field 
            is given by
        </p>

        <p>\[F = \frac{Qq}{4 \pi \epsilon d^2} \]</p>

        <p>Where \(F\) is the force, \(Q\) is the charge of on particle,
            \(q\) is the charge of the other particle, \(\epsilon\) is the 
            permittivity of the medium and \(d\) is the distance between the 
            charges
        </p>

        <p>We can abstract this by defining an electric field strength</p>

        <p>\[E = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon d^2}\]</p>

        <p>Thus a small test charge \(q\) placed inside this field will 
            experience force 
        </p>

        <p>\[F = qE\]</p>

        <p>However, this analysis is a little thin. It has the flaw of not
            working for non-uniform fields. It also isn't a vector, and really
            we should try and put all relationships into 3 dimensional space.
            Therefore, let's bring this equation into the third dimension.
        </p>

        <p>\[\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = q \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})\]</p>

        <p>The equation has been given an upgrade! Now force and electric
            field are vectors, and we introduce \(r\), a vector for the position
            of the test charge within the electric field.
        </p>
        
        <p>We can actually do a very similar thing for gravity</p>

        <p>\[\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = m \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r})\]</p>

        <p>The fields behave more or less the same. The only difference of 
            course being that gravity acts upon mass rather than charge.
        </p>

        <p>We are also now prepared to make a definition of a new concept:
            energy. We define the work done as the distance travelled when a 
            force is applied. As an equation we can simply write this as
        </p>

        <p>\[W = F \times s\]</p>

        {# Save this for later - work done can be derived from the example #}

        <p>But this form has some flaws. For one, it is only a scalar, and we
            prefer vectors where possible. Also, it doesn't allow us to work
            with non-uniform fields. To fix this, as usual, we introduce an 
            integral.
        </p>

        <p>\[\Delta W = \int \mathbf{F} d\mathbf{s}\]</p>

        {# Might need to segwey into this section #}

        <p>Let's consider a falling object again. This is an object falling
            due to gravity, starting at rest. Earlier chapters have shown us
            that the velocity will be given by \(y = at = gt\) and 
            \(y = \frac{1}{2} g t^2\). Let's begin by eliminating \(t\) from 
            these equations.
        </p>

        <p>If we rearrange \(y = gt\) into \(t = \frac{y}{g}\) and substitute
            into \(y = \frac{1}{2} g t^2\) we get
        </p>

        <p>\[y = \frac{1}{2} g \frac{v^2}{g^2} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{v^2}{g}\]</p>

        <p>Now, let's try and think about this in another way. Consider this
            problem in terms of average velocity. Since the object starts from 
            rest, \(u = 0\). Therefore, if the distance travelled is the average
            velocity times time, then \(y = \frac{1}{2} (v - 0) t = 
            \frac{1}{2}vt\). Also consider that velocity is given by \(v = gt\),
            since we are starting from rest. A simple substitution will give us
        </p>

        <p>\[y = \frac{1}{2} v \frac{v}{g} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{v^2}{g}\]</p>

        <p>which is the same result from a moment ago.</p>

        <p>Now consider if this object had an initial downward velocity, \(u\).
            Let's repeat the same analysis. Well, now the distance will be given
            by \(y = \frac{1}{2} (v + u)t \), still simply the average velocity
            times time. The final velocity will now be given by 
            \(v = u + gt\). Now if we rearrange for \(t\) we find
            \(t = \frac{v - u}{g}\). Now let's try substituting for \(t\) to 
            find
        </p>

        <p>\[y = \frac{1}{2} \frac{(v - u)(v+u)}{g} = 
            \frac{1}{2} \frac{v^2 - u^2}{g}\]</p>

        <p>Now, let's find an expression for the product of the force 
            (\(mg\)) with distance.
        </p>

        <p>\[mgy = \frac{1}{2} mg \frac{(v - u)(v+u)}{g} 
            = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{1}{2} m u^2\]</p>

        <p>I will very suggestively not cancel the \(m\).</p>

        <p>Finally, let's plug some "numbers" in. Consider the object falls from
            \(h_1\) to \(h_2\) such that \(y = h_1 - h_2\). 
        </p>

        <p>\[mg (h_1 - h_2) = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{1}{2} m u^2\]</p>

        <p>And then let's group together the start terms and end terms</p>

        <p>\[mgh_1 + \frac{1}{2} m u^2 = mgh_2 + \frac{1}{2} m v^2\]</p>

        <p>What we have made here is an equation that is independent of time,
            showing some values that are conserved. We call these conserved 
            values energy. Total energy in a system, much like with momentum, is
            always conserved. It can change between different "kinds" though.
            In this instance there are two "kinds" of energy - potential 
            (represented by the \(mgh\) terms) and kinetic (represented by the
            \(\frac{1}{2} mv^2\) terms). We will be exploring potential and 
            kinetic energy more in future, but for now I want to quickly 
            introduce a new concept - work done. Work done represents this 
            conversion from one kind of energy to other by a force.
        </p>

        <p>Work done can crudely be described as the force times the distance
            travelled. This holds for uniform forces in one dimension - we will
            explore three dimension and non-uniform forces soon.
        </p>

        <h2>Fields in Three Dimensions</h2>

        <p>Let's consider the three dimensional version of these problems. 
            If we consider that in three dimensions acceleration due to gravity
            for a falling object is given by 
        </p>

        <p>\[\mathbf{g} = \frac{\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u}}{t}\]</p>

        <p>and the displacement given by</p>

        <p>\[\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}) t\]</p>

        <p>We can eliminate \(t\) from these equations by taking the scalar 
            product. Earlier I was not quite candid on why we would want to
            eliminate \(t\) so badly. Remember, by eliminating the time-evolving
            part of a system we arrive at the time-invariant parts.
        </p>

        <p>\[\mathbf{g} \cdot \mathbf{s} = \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u})
            (\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u}) = \frac{1}{2} (v^2 - u^2)\]
        </p>

        <p>Remembering our definition of work done as the force applied over a 
            distance, it maps easily into three dimensions by
        </p>

        <p>\[W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{s}\]</p>

        <p>And let's use our result to figure out what the work done is in this
            instance.
        </p>

        <p>\[W = m \mathbf{g} \cdot \mathbf{s} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - 
            \frac{1}{2} m u^2\]
        </p>

        <p>By definition, \(\frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{1}{2} m u^2\) is the 
            change in kinetic energy, so again, the work done by the 
            gravitational field is equal to the change in kinetic energy.
        </p>

        <h2>Non-uniform Fields</h2>

        <p>As you might have guessed, moving from uniform to non-uniform 
            solutions generally requires us to use integrals. Writing the
            equations we already have as integrals we find
        </p>

        <p>\[\Delta W = \int \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{s}\]</p>

        <p>\[\Delta \phi = - \int \mathbf{g} \cdot d \mathbf{s}\]</p>

        <p>\[\Delta \phi = - \int \mathbf{E} \cdot d \mathbf{s}\]</p>

        <p>These are very special kinds of integrals called line integrals - 
            we really do add up every value along the path \(\mathbf{s}\). Let's
            do some example problems using line integrals to see how to work
            with them.
        </p>
