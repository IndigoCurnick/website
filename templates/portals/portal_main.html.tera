        <p>Here is a list of my portals. These portals are homepages or collections of related content that I find
            interesting</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><a href="/portals/economic_portal">Economics Portal</a></dt>
            <dd>Economically, I mostly study the history of economics. Not the history of economic thought but rather
                the economies of nations in the past. My perspective on economics has been formed mostly by the greatest
                economist of all time: Ludwig von Mises.</dd>
            <dt><a href="/portals/history_portal">History Portal</a></dt>
            <dd>My interests in history are quite varied, but here I mostly focus on historiography rather than any
                particular historical event as with the Anglo-Dutch portal.</dd>
            <dt><a href="/portals/philosophy_portal">Philosophy Portal</a></dt>
            <dd>Philosophically, I have mostly studied epistemology, and considered the capacity for what it is possible
                to know.</dd>
            <dt><a href="/portals/politics_portal">Politics Portal</a></dt>
            <dd>Politically speaking I mostly follow the Machiavellian school of political analysis based on
                understanding power and its applications.</dd>
            <dt><a href="/portals/science_portal">Science, Maths, Programming and Technology Portal</a></dt>
            <dd>I studied a masters in physics at the University of Sussex, specialising in neutrino physics. Since
                then I have remained interested in all aspects of science </dd>
            <dt><a href="/portals/urban_portal">Urban Planning Portal</a></dt>
            <dd>For a long time I have been concerned with urban planning. I firmly believe that the post-war consensus
                planning of the British state was an abject failure; we should seek alternatives to this drudgery in our
                cities and towns.</dd>
